# Android Quality Migration Log

This log records the evidence for each independently committed migration step. It does
not replace the final release matrix in `QUALITY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`.

## Compile SDK 36

- Commit: `79dfa84e`
- `compileSdk`: 36
- `targetSdk`: 34
- Android Gradle Plugin: 8.10.1
- Gradle: 8.14.5
- `verifyLocal`: passed
- Lint: no new findings; the reviewed baseline remained at 67 entries

## Target SDK 35

- `targetSdk`: 35
- Android 15 edge-to-edge behavior is handled with explicit system-bar and display-cutout
  insets.
- The stream content root owns the safe rectangle, so the video surface, local cursor,
  overlays, and touch coordinates use the same geometry.
- Fullscreen stream behavior preserves the existing user opt-in for drawing into display
  cutouts. Visible system bars are protected in multi-window mode.
- Settings, help, host, app, file-share, about, and credits screens retain safe content
  areas under enforced edge-to-edge.
- The app does not request audio focus, so Android 15's target-gated audio-focus
  restriction does not require a compatibility path.

Verification on 2026-07-30:

- `verifyLocal`: passed
- JVM tests: passed, including four stream-inset policy tests
- All four root/non-root debug/release Lint variants: passed
- Both root and non-root Release builds: passed
- Lint: no new findings; the reviewed baseline remained at 67 entries
- Connected device: `192.168.3.125:5555`, Xiaomi `23116PN5BC`, API 36
- `connectedNonRootDebugAndroidTest`: 31 passed
- `connectedRootDebugAndroidTest`: 31 passed

The connected tests establish lifecycle and component compatibility. Real streaming,
input-coordinate alignment, clipboard, and microphone checks remain part of the final
manual release gate.
